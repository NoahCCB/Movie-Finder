Creative Portion: For my creative portion I implemented three new features to my app, all of which utilize the
TMDb databases types. For this features I created new classes for each pages ViewController and two new files for UITableViewCell subtypes

1) For my first creative portion I added a theaters tab where users can click and scroll through movies that are currently in theaters,
this is a tableView and allows users to scroll through and see movies and their release_date. the Movies are each clickable and clicking them
brings the user to a search for tickets for that movie. For this tableView I made new classes for the cells and implemented it to be scrolling and
appealing.

2) For my second creative portion I added a recommendations page, this page is also a tableView that automatically compiles a long list of recommended
movies based off of the movies in the users favorites. This uses the userDefaults arrays and gets the recommended movies for each movie in the users favorites
Clicking each movie impliments the new type MovieTableViewCell and allows the user to see details about the movie.

3) For my final creative portion, I made it so that when the user first opens the app, or when the search bar is entered while empty, a list of the trending movies for
today comes up. I thought to do this since there is so much empty white space on the main page that makes the app look rather unappealing when opened. I thought it best that 
users can see the trending movies and have the feed populated and before they start searching
